      <h3>Diabetic Prediction using ML</h3>
      <p>The Diabetic Prediction using ML project is a machine learning-based application that aims to predict the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes based on various health parameters. It utilizes a trained ML model to make accurate predictions and provide valuable insights.</p>
      <p>The project involves collecting a dataset that includes relevant health features such as age, BMI, glucose levels, blood pressure, and insulin levels. The dataset is then used to train a machine learning model, such as logistic regression or random forest, to classify individuals as either diabetic or non-diabetic.</p>
      <p>Once the model is trained, the web application allows users to input their health parameters into the system. The ML model then processes the input and generates a prediction, indicating the likelihood of the user developing diabetes. The prediction can help individuals assess their risk and take appropriate preventive measures.</p>
      <p>The Diabetic Prediction using ML project was implemented using Python and popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn or TensorFlow. The web interface was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing an intuitive and user-friendly experience.</p>
